# Smart_Cage

## Project Goal
The goal is to build a smart cage system for temporary pet storage.

- Implement a server using Raspberry Pi 4
- Real-time control of the cage's temperature, humidity, illuminance, and DC motor using STM32
- Implement an administrator system using Arduino (user controllable)
- Implement real-time status monitoring function using environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, illuminance)
- Develop a server-based user control system (lighting, ventilation window, fan, etc.)
- Design an efficient board architecture with separated input sensors and output control
- Inter-device linkage and integrated management via TCP/IP-based Wi-Fi communication

## Names and Roles
| Name | Role | Board |
|---|---|---|
| **User** | User command input and status check interface | LDplayer4 (Mobile) |
| **Server** | - Central control server for the entire system<br>- Receives and stores cage status from all CCUs<br>- Processes user control requests<br>- Bluetooth communication with the administrator MCU<br>- Records cage allocation, device operation status, rental time, etc. | Raspberry Pi |
| **CCU (Cage Control Unit)** | - One installed in each cage<br>- Measures temperature, humidity, and illuminance<br>- Controls internal lighting LED and status LED<br>- Controls window opening/closing motor<br>- Controls fan motor<br>- LCD status display<br>- Communicates directly with the server via Wi-Fi | STM32 |
| **MCU (Manager Control Unit)** | - Administrator-only control board<br>- Communicates with the server (Raspberry Pi) via Bluetooth<br>- Monitors the entire cage status<br>- Transmits administrator control commands (window, LED, fan, buzzer, etc.) | Arduino + Bluetooth module |
